TOP Project #1

This is a clone of the Google homepage, deconstructed and rebuilt for the Odin Project.

Instructions: 

Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. 
Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. 
Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.


* Navigation bars are made with nested flexbox.
